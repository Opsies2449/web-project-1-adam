      <h2>Fun Facts about Bananas</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Bananas are technically berries.</li>
        <li>They float in water because they are less dense than water.</li>
        <li>
          There are over 1,000 different varieties of bananas across the world.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This type of banana is known as the "wild banana" and is the ancestor of
        all the normal bananas we eat today.<br />
        Wild bananas are smaller, have more seeds and not as sweet as the other
        types.

      <h2>When was <i>bananas</i> popularized?</h2>
      <h2>
        Bananas were popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
        mostly in countries like the United States and Europe.<br />It is
        possible because of the introduction of refrigerated shipping that
        allowed bananas to be transported over long distances<br />
        without spoiling or rotting, making them more fresh and more accessible.
        Companies like the United Fruit Company played<br />
        a significant role in promoting bananas.
