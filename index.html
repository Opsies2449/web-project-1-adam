      This type of banana is known as the "wild banana" and is the ancestor of
      the cultivated banana we eat today.<br />
      Wild bananas are smaller, seedier, and not as sweet as their cultivated
      counterparts.

    <h1>When was <b>bananas</b> popularized?</h1>
    <h2>
      Bananas were popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
      mostly in countries like the United States and Europe.<br />It is possible because of the introduction of
      refrigerated shipping allowed bananas to be transported over long
      distances without spoiling<br />, making them more fresh and more accessible.
      Companies like the United Fruit Company played a significant
      role <br />in promoting bananas as a staple fruit in many households
      during this time.
