    <h1>When was <b>bananas</b> popularized?</h1>
    <h2>
      Bananas were popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
      particularly in the United States and Europe.<br />The introduction of
      refrigerated shipping allowed bananas to be transported over long
      distances without spoiling<br />, making them more accessible to
      consumers. Companies like the United Fruit Company played a significant
      role <br />in promoting bananas as a staple fruit in many households
      during this time.
